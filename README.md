# AwfulBatchToCTranspiler
as the name says on the tin, its a very unoptimized compiler made in batch that compiles batch to c.

Requirements: MINGW GNUCC and WINDOWS OS with BATCH support.

#support: only print statements are supported for now, complex macros may fail.
SCRAPPED: Sadly, on complex input reflection bites me in the keister and prompts/other commands will accidentally run and produce output on the C source code at the other end. So only simple ECHOS work for now.

#testbat.bat: a dumb echo batch script to try compiling
