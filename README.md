# AwfulBatchToCTranspiler
as the name says on the tin, its a very unoptimized compiler made in batch that compiles batch to c.


## Requirements: 
MINGW GNUCC and WINDOWS OS with BATCH support.

## Support: 
only print statements are supported for now, complex macros may fail. Issue #1 is present until splitting is fixed.

## testbat.bat: 
a dumb echo batch script to try compiling
